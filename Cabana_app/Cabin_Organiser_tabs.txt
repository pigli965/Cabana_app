Hero Section - 95% of modern websites are using this

Core:
- What the business does?
- What services they provide?

Main Headline:	[We will get you this result]
- Should clearly communicate:
	- the value
	- the result
	- the transformation that you're promising with what you offer.
	
Sub Headline:	[And here is how]
- Is there to support your headline by clearly explaining how  you get them that result
- In other words.. Now is the time to bring that thing that you offer

- Check marks under the SubHeadline that are:
	- Results that they can expect
	- Different use cases for what you offer
	
Call To Action Button:
- Is there to give anyone who's ready to go a really clear easy path forward to getting start working with

- Should be really prominent and bold so it's extremely obvious where they need to click next
- Should be word it to be really actionable and specific so it should NEVER be something like contact us or learn more
- It should be very descriptive of actually what it comes next

Image:
- People will look at the main image on a website for nearly 6 seconds on average
- Very important that you can emotionally connect with the most people
- Should be real representation of the happy after state that your customers are feeling
- Should be really natural and overall positive

If you are a service business just show that happy feeling in some kind of context so
people should be able to visualize themselves having the happy feeling


Problem/Solution section - 2 or 3 short paragraphs that lay out the problem that your customer is likely experiencing right now


To do this right: [Dog Training Example]
- use the tried and true what marketers csll the Pain agitate solution copywriting framework here

1st Main Pain Point
- something like you know.. you love your dog, but let's face it.. he's a bit much

2nd Agitate with examples
- then you will agitate that pain with bringing up examples of bad behaviour like
	- maybe he's hard to take on walks
	- to do friendly restaurant patios
	- he's always jumping up on your friends
	- and maybe you've even had trouble keeping dog sitters as a result
	
3rd Introduce your solution
- but not to worry because here's our solution that's going to turn it all around


1,2,3 paragraphs pro tips:

Make the first paragraph's text a little bit bigger than normal
- reason is there was a recent eye tracking study that showed when test subjects saw a story with a bold or larger introductory paragraph,
95% of them viewed all or part of it which is a lot more than you'll see for typical texts on website especially when it's several paragraphs long like this
- so you bring them in with a larger text and then if you write it well enough and you lay out the pain points right, that will pull them all the way through the rest of it

- pair the text with a really short video for your business along side of it
	- something that hits on the problem you solve and how
	- will help you be more memorable and trustworthy
	- it keeps people on your page longer which is great Google signal to help you rank higher in Search
	- pages with video on them increase conversions by 86% on average.


Benefits section

You just want to call out three main benefits that your customer can expect from you.
[Very important!]
- because this is where you'll try to set yourself apart from your competitors by either:
	- bringing up extras or perks that you bring and your competition doesn't
	- maybe these are the things they do too but if you're the one talking about it and they're not, the end result's the same.
- benefits tend to trip people up because they always confuse them with features 

So..
1st List out your most compelling 3 benefits
2nd Go into the features that makes the benefits possible
3rd Some kind of a visual that helps illustrate each benefit (photos / icons)


Testimonials section

Social proof like this so that people can see proof that what you're claiming is true
- 72% of consumers will take action only after reading a positive review
- rule of three:
	- recommended to find three testimonials that do a really good job saying something that's going to help someone overcome:
		- an objection (they may have)
		- speak to one of your benefits
		- results
	- keep them really short
	- include their photo if you can get their permision to use it
	- use a 5 star.


Features section

This is the part where we let t ytical people who really just need to justify their emotional buy-in by seeing exactly what they're gonna get.

- bullet list / check list / with icons for each one.


FAQs section	

Proactively answer common questions that people ask you all the time.
But more importantly this is the place to proactively handle objections that they may have too.

What are the top five or six questions that people need answered or objections that they need settled before they'll feel comfortable taking the next step?
- Just write each one out as a question then address each one with your answer.
- If it is an objection -> what's your best rebuttal against that objection.
- Keep them really short
- This is another great use case for video on your homepage
- If you create a really short video for each FAQ with your best answer for it, that's going to:
	- build even more trust and get you even closer to that sale or book.
	
Call To Action section

A really simple call to action section where you simply ask them if they're ready to get started.
And repeat the same call to action button here as you had up in the hero section.
